Hi Everyone, Yesterday we see about creating a GitHub account and Installation of GitBash in our local device.Then we import the already existed directory into our GitHub. Then we some of the basic commands like making directory, changing the directory and the configure the username, email, password for the GitHub and setting the security as false and cloning the imported directory to our local device and then creating a branch using git command and then we created a file inside the folder and then we checked the status of the git and it shows the untracked file in it and then we performed add, commit and push operation in it
